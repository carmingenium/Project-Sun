Blacked Out Engineer: IS IT DEAD!!!!
Security Officer: I THINK SO!
Head of Security: Get to the air alarm and fix the damn engine.
Blacked Out Engineer: Umm...
Blacked Out Engineer: I am fully awake but I think I'm not seeing right..
Security Officer: Stop stalling and fix this.
Blacked Out Engineer: Sure yeah..
Blacked Out Engineer: But um.. its 80.000 Kelvins in there. It shouldn't ever get to there.
Head of Security: Can we cool it down?
Blacked Out Engineer: I am 100 percent sure we can't. The radiation started to leak and my sight is getting worse.
Head of Security: So all of this was for nothing?
Blacked Out Engineer: Can't we like order a new one so I can set it up? This one will explode any second..
Head of Security: UGH.... Let's head out, I will check the cargo budget.
Security Officer: Wasn't that cargo technician the only one in the station?
Head of Security: Well for some reason it worked really hard. I didn't see this many zero's on a budget before.
Head of Security: Alright let's head out. Clown, Mime.. drop those insulated gloves..
Mime: silently sobs*
